## What’s New in 2019

Instead of a registration queue, there’s a series of drawings for registration tokens. Please read this through carefully.

## Key Points

  * Campfire Tails 2019 is limited to 230 attendees.

  * There is NO on-site registration.

  * To register, you must first win a registration token from a drawing that runs every 2 weeks.

  * Winners have a week* to claim their token, then pay and finish registration.

  * Winners also get a +1 token that can be given to a friend who entered but lost the drawing.

  * Losing a drawing increases your chance of winning the next drawing you enter, and this also carries over to next year.

  * You must be 18 years of age to attend Campfire Tails.

  * You must show an approved form of government-issued photo ID at check-in.

  * You can’t transfer your registration, but you can get a refund before the refund deadline.

## How to Register

  * Log in to the registration system and make sure your profile information is up to date.

  * Enter the current registration drawing.

    ⚠️ Make sure you enter the first drawing! We don’t hold back tokens for later drawings. Later drawings only get unused tokens and cancellations.

    ⚠️ If your friends want to come, make sure they enter too! +1 tokens can only be given to people who entered the same drawing.

  * Log in after the drawing to see if you’ve won.

    ⚠️ We will not send email notifications. (Too many notifications were lost to spam filters in previous years.)

      * If you don’t win:

          * Reach out to your friends and the CFT community to see if anyone has a +1 token they can give you.

          * Enter the next registration drawing when it opens next week. Losing this drawing gives you a higher chance of winning the next drawing.

            ⚠️ You are not automatically entered into the next drawing.

      * If you do win:

          * Pay for your registration before the deadline for this drawing, which is 1 week for most drawings, and 2 days for the Last-Minute Drawing.

          * Payment is only accepted via PayPal, through the registration system.

          * You cannot give your token to someone else.

          * The registration token expires before the next drawing starts.

      * Winning also gives you a +1 token.

          * If there are not enough tokens for everyone who entered a drawing, then tokens will be allocated in pairs.

          * The second token becomes a +1 token, which winners will get when they finish registering.

          * The +1 token can be given to anyone who entered but lost this drawing.

          * The recipient of the +1 token must pay for and finish registration themselves.

          * The +1 token expires before the next drawing starts.

## Cost

* All registration options include 3 meals a day prepared by our glorious kitchen crew: Everyone gets hot supper, Patrons get hot breakfast, and Sponsors and Patrons get hot lunch.

* You can upgrade your registration at any time until 5:59 AM on Monday, July 8th. After that time, upgrades are closed, and new registrations will be limited to the “Attendee” option.

* CFT2019 Attendee — $60

* Admission to Campfire Tails with full event access, cold breakfast and lunch, and a hearty hot dinner.

* CFT2019 Sponsor — $90

* All benefits of regular admission plus hot lunch, a convention T-Shirt, and a special Sponsor gift.

* CFT2019 Patron — $120

* All benefits of regular admission plus hot breakfast, hot lunch, a convention T-Shirt personalized with your name, and a special Patron gift in addition to the Sponsor gift.

* Meat Fund Contribution — +$5

* Out of respect for vegetarian attendees who do not want to financially support the meat industry, we encourage everyone who does want to eat meals with meat to explicitly opt-in.

* This contribution is strictly optional: declining to contribute will not result in you being denied the meat-included version of any meal your registration option includes.
How the Drawing Works

  * Everyone starts with 0 points.

  * Anytime you win a drawing, your points are reset to 0.

  * Anytime you enter but lose, you get 1 more point.

  * Points carry over to next year.

  * If there are more entries than available tokens, the tokens are awarded in pairs (for the +1 tokens).

  * 75% of the tokens are awarded in a way that favors points.
      * Winners are picked randomly from all the entrants that are tied for the most points.
      * This is repeated until there are no more tokens in this pool.

  * 25% of the tokens are awarded randomly, ignoring points.

  * This lets everyone have some chance of winning a token, even if this is the first time they enter.

## Refunds

* If you know you can’t make it, please request a refund ASAP so we can let someone else attend!

  * Requests for refunds must be submitted electronically, via the registration system.

  * Refunds will be issued only via PayPal, and will not exceed the amount actually paid.

    (Registration credits are a discount, not an amount owed to you.)

  * Attendee registrations are fully refundable until 5:59 AM on July 29th.

  * Sponsor and Patron registrations are fully refundable until 5:59 AM on July 8th.

  * After that time, your Sponsor/Patron gifts have already been ordered, so only the basic Attendee portion of your registration is eligible to be refunded.

  * If you request a (partial) refund of a Sponsor/Patron registration between 5:59 AM on July 8th and the final refund deadline of 5:59 AM on July 29th, we’ll ship your Sponsor/Patron gifts to you after the event.

## Missed Swag Pick-Ups

* We don’t hold on to swag for Attendees, only Sponsors and Patrons.

* If you’re registered as a Sponsor or Patron, didn’t request a refund, and don’t pick up your Sponsor/Patron gifts at the event, we’ll hold on to them for you to pick up another year.

* Note: You may designate someone else to pick up your Sponsor/Patron gifts for you if you don’t make it to the event. This option is available in the registration system until 5:59 AM on July 31st.

## Appendix: For Staff and 2018 Volunteers

* If you volunteered during Campfire Tails 2018, you have a pre-registration token.

* Pre-registration starts 6:00 AM on Monday April 15 and ends 5:59 AM on Monday May 13.

* If you’re unable to register during the pre-registration period, please contact info@campfiretails.org ASAP.

* If you miss pre-registration, your pre-registration token expires. You’ll have to get another token from the normal registration drawings.

* Kitchen volunteers get an extra pre-registration token they can give to a friend, which the friend can use during the pre-registration period. (This is not the same as a +1 token.)

* Anyone who pre-registers (including friend pre-reg) can still enter normal registration drawings to win a +1 token you can give to a friend. You’ll also get points if you enter and lose.

* Make sure your friend also enters the registration drawing. You cannot give a +1 token to someone who didn’t enter.
